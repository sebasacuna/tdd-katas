##### Katas Todo

- [x] Roman Numbers
- [x] Fizz and Buzz
  * If number is multiple of three and five return FizzBuzz
  * If number is multiple of three return Fizz
  * If number is multiple of five return Buzz
  * Otherwise return the number
- [x] Greeter
  * Write a Greeter class with greet function that receives a name as input and outputs Hello <name>. The signature of greet should not change throughout the kata. You are allowed to construct Greeter object as you please.
  * Greet trims the input
  * Greet capitalizes the first letter of the name
  * Greet returns Good morning <name> when the time is 06:00-12:00
  * Greet returns Good evening <name> when the time is 18:00-22:00
  * Greet returns Good night <name> when the time is 22:00-06:00
- [ ] String Calculator (Write a method add under an object StringCalculator that, given a delimited string, returns the sum of the numbers in the string.)
  * An empty string return zero `""=> 0`
  * A single number returns the value `'1' => 1 ` `'2' => 2`
  * Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum `'1,2' => 3` `10,20 => 30`
